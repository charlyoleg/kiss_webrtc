*kiss_webrtc* is a small sandbox project to play with WebRTC_.

.. _WebRTC : https://webrtc.org/


It contains three clients:

- web-client
- nodejs-client

Each client can act as a share-point with the other clients or a simple end-user client

The nodejs-server is only there for the initial signaling.
